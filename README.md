# 02-Responsive-Portfolio-NK

Week 2 Homework for UNH Coding Bootcamp: Responsive Portfolio. In this project, I created my portfolio from scratch. I focused on using semantic elements and using the bootstrap grid system when designing my website.

Parts of my Website:
1. About Me 
2. Portfolio
3. Contact

Challenges:
Designing the navigation bar was the hardest part for me. I worked on creating a functioning nav bar (that was not adjusting how I wanted based on different screen sizes) using a bootstrap template and then built the content and layout on the 3 pages (besides the nav bar).  After the 3 pages were functioning correctly, I worked on the footer and re-working my nav-bar to resize correctly based on sm, md, and lg screens.
